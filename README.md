##FFmpeg is required for full funcionality:
- If FFmpeg is under this path C:/FFmpeg12/bin everything is fine
- Otherwise you have to create a ffmpeg.txt file in the same folder the .exe is
- In this file you put your path to the ffmpeg/bin folder
- Use "/" instead of "\" if you copy the path out of windows you have to replace them
